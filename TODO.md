# TODO

## Bugs to fix
- [ ] Sometimes misses songs when audio is too quiet (normalization helps but not perfect)
- [ ] Arrow keys on Linux terminals can be weird - works on my machine though
- [ ] Voice search gets confused with background noise

## Features I want to add
- [ ] Spotify integration (JioSaavn is ok but Spotify would be better)
- [ ] Desktop notifications when a song is found
- [ ] Export history to CSV or something
- [ ] Maybe add a web interface? Terminal is cool but friends think it's weird
- [ ] Lyrics display would be sick
- [ ] Better error messages when PyAudio fails

## Performance 
- [ ] Recognition is a bit slow sometimes, maybe cache results?
- [ ] Downloads could be faster
- [ ] Memory usage gets high after running for hours

## Code cleanup
- [ ] Refactor the input handling - it's messy
- [ ] Better type hints
- [ ] Add some tests maybe?

## Ideas
- Make it work as a service/daemon
- Android app using same backend
- Discord bot version??
